# Phaser NPM Webpack TypeScript Starter Project (catchy name, isn't it?)

##### Hit the ground running and make some great games!

###### If you use this template/starter project in any capacity; I'd love to hear about your experience with it. Whether you continued with it or decided not too (I really want to hear why you made your decision).

# Setup
To use this you’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project. But once you have node.js installed it only takes a few seconds and a couple commands to get going.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/rroylance/phaser-npm-webpack-typescript-starter-project.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

## 4. Run the watch process:

Run:

```npm run watch```

This will start a watch process, so you can change the source or assets (anything in src/ or assets/) and the process will trigger a compilation of the game.

###### Note: If you have run the development sever (step 5) this re-compilation will trigger a refresh in the browser as well.

## 5. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run live-server```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:9000/dist/ into the address bar (if it didn't open automatically/you closed the tab or window).

## Build for testing/developing/debugging:

Run:

```npm run build:dev```

This will build the game with a few caveats;
- A compile time flag, DEBUG, set to true; allowing you to include or not include certain code depending on if it's DEBUG build or not.
- The resulting game.js will not be minified and will include source maps

## Build for release:

Run:

```npm run build:dist```

This will build the game with a few caveats;
- The compile time flag, DEBUG, set to false; allowing you to include or not include certain code depending on if it's DEBUG build or not.
- The resulting game.min.js will be minified and will not include source maps
