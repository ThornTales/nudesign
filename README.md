# Phaser NPM Webpack TypeScript Starter Project (catchy name, isn't it?)

##### Hit the ground running and make some great games!

###### If you use this template/starter project in any capacity; I'd love to hear about your experience with it. Whether you continued with it or decided not to (I really want to hear why you made your decision).

# Features

- Phaser-CE 2.7.3 (npm module, no having to download the library seperatley...)
- TypeScript + TSLint
- 3 States (Boot, Preloader, Title) showing transition between states and where some things should be done and how a TypeScript state looks
- Google Web Font loader
- Webpack
- Seperate Development and Distribution builds
- Live server (builds and reloads the browser on changes)
- Setting up the game size and scaling through a script that does it all for you
  - Automatic template background
  - Sets up the size the game so that it is scaled only when absolutley necessary 
  - Refer to src/utils/utils.ts for an explanation on the background_template and the sizing/scaling style

### Features coming soon

- Webpack asset manifest integration
- Yeoman Generator

### Features coming eventually (aka when I need it... sooner if there is a demand for it)

- Analytics integration
- Cordova integration for iOS and Android builds

# Setup
To use this you’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project. But once you have node.js installed it only takes a few seconds and a couple commands to get going.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/rroylance/phaser-npm-webpack-typescript-starter-project.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm (npm is included and installed with node.js):

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

## 4. Run the dev server:

Run to use the dev build while developing:

```npm run server:dev```

Run to use the dist build while developing 

```npm run server:dist```

###### The only real reason I can think of to use the dist server is if the minification process is breaking something in your game and you need to test using the minified version, or something you excluded with the DEBUG flag shouldn't have been excluded.

This will run a server that serves your built game straight to the browser and will be built and reloaded automatically anytime a change is detected.

## Build for testing/developing/debugging:

Run:

```npm run build:dev```

This will build the game with a few caveats;
- A compile time flag, DEBUG, set to true; allowing you to include or not include certain code depending on if it's DEBUG build or not.
- The resulting game.js will not be minified and will include source maps

## Build for release:

Run:

```npm run build:dist```

This will build the game with a few caveats;
- The compile time flag, DEBUG, set to false; allowing you to include or not include certain code depending on if it's DEBUG build or not.
- The resulting game.min.js will be minified and will not include source maps

## Change the game size and generate a template background

Note: This is automatically run after running npm install, however you may want to run it again (if you deleted the background.png and want it back, or if you want to change the game size from the default).

Run:

```npm run setupGameSize```

This will run a script that will generate a template background showing the safe and decoration area of your game when it is sized or scaled for different devices as well as updating a couple global values in the webpack configs so that the game knows about the new size when built.

If you do not want the default 800 x 500, run the following and all will be updated.

**DO NOT MODIFY THE (DEFAULT|MAX)\_GAME\_(WIDTH|HEIGHT) PLUGINS DEFINED IN THE WEBPACK CONFIGS, OR THIS WILL NOT WORK**;

```node ./scripts/setupGameSize --width [whatever width you want] --height [whatever height you want] [--no-png]```

You can either provide the width **and** height and as long as they result in an aspect ratio of what's set in the script (default 1.6 or 16:10), or you can provide the width **or** height and the one you didn't provide will be calculated for you. If you do not want the background to be created just add the flag --no-png (not putting this will let the background generate).
